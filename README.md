# Multi-Label Text Classification

## Problem Statement / Objectives
One source of unstructured data in healthcare is the post-care surveys that are completed by patients. The surveys typically contain a free-text comment as well as numerical ratings to standard quantified questions. Mechanisms for collecting such unstructured feedback from patients have become commonplace, though there still exist huge gaps in the effective analysis of the feedback. The objective of this test is to use text-mining techniques on a set of free-form textual comments to evaluate patients’ perceptions.

## Data Description
This dataset consists of two sheets: the sheet “Labeled” contains 70 labeled comments categorized into three groups: Hospital Staff, Hospital Environment, and Discharge Process. The sheet “Unlabeled” contains 30 comments that are not labeled.
